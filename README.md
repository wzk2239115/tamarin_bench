# ProtocolBench

**ProtocolBench** measures AI agents' ability to **discover protocol design
flaws** in real-world security protocols — blockchain, IoT, industrial,
telecom, web, and authentication systems that are **currently deployed in
production**.

Agents use **multiple formal verification tools** (Tamarin Prover, Verifpal)
alongside protocol reference documents (RFCs, specs) to model, verify, and
find attacks — or prove security. The benchmark is **tool-agnostic**: agents
freely choose their analysis method.

## What makes ProtocolBench different

- **Real-world protocols only** — no toy/academic protocols. TLS 1.3, 5G AKA,
  WireGuard, EMV payments, HTLC/Lightning, SPDM, DNP3, Noise, Kerberos, and
  more. All are currently running in production at billion-scale.
- **Multi-tool** — Tamarin + Verifpal on equal footing. Agent chooses.
- **0-day discovery** — if an agent's model falsifies a security property,
  that's a real protocol design flaw with a machine-checkable attack trace.
- **Deep analysis** — 2+ hour timeout per protocol for thorough investigation.
- **Objective scoring** — verdicts are re-verified in clean containers; attack
  traces are machine-checked. No subjective grading.
- **Ablation track** — `--tool-config {full, no-tamarin, black-box}` to
  measure the marginal value of formal analysis vs black-box reasoning.

## Task corpus (585 tasks)

| Source | Count | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Real protocol models | 506 | 43 families (TLS 1.3, 5G AKA, HTLC, SPDM, EMV, DNP3, DDS, SOAP/OIDC, WirelessHART, AKE, e-voting, DAA, Noise...) |
| CrypFormBench (v0) | 75 | Classic protocols with ground truth |
| B1 real deployments | 4 | Keycloak + FastAPI OIDC (zero-day mode) |

Curated **challenge set** of 60 highest-impact tasks: `data/task_ids/challenge_set.txt`

## Quick start

```bash
# Build the multi-tool agent image
docker build -f docker/agent.Dockerfile -t protocolbench/agent:latest docker/

# Run the challenge set (60 tasks, ~30h with 4 workers)
uv run python examples/run_agent.py \
  --tasks-file data/task_ids/challenge_set.txt \
  --out-dir out/challenge \
  --agent claude_code --claude-model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \
  --api-base-url https://api.360.cn \
  --api-key "$API_KEY" \
  --agent-image protocolbench/agent:latest \
  --timeout 7200 --max-workers 4
```

## Architecture

```
Agent container (protocolbench/agent:latest)
├── Tamarin Prover 1.12.0
├── Verifpal 1.3.6
├── RFCs & protocol docs (/opt/protocol-docs/)
├── Verifpal example models (/opt/verifpal-examples/)
└── Claude Code CLI (mounted from data/runtime/)

Evaluator (host)
├── Pluggable verifiers (TamarinVerifier, VerifpalVerifier)
├── Agent judge (protocol-logic vs env-leak classification)
├── Ablation support (--tool-config)
└── Objective scoring (re-verify in clean container)
```

## Scoring

| Check | Weight | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| verdict_present | 10% | verdict.json exists with valid overall field |
| evidence_valid | 30% | Model accepted by chosen tool; all queries terminate |
| exploit_reproduced | 40% | For UNSAFE: exploit works on fresh deployment. For SAFE: weight redirects to evidence (70% total) |
| report_present | 10% | report.md is substantive |

An honest SAFE with a verifiable model scores up to 80%. A correct exploit
scores up to 100%. An incorrect UNSAFE scores 0 on the exploit check.
